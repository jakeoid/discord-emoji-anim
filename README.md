# Discord Emoji Animations.

When you first begin with Discord you're left with some pretty subpar level Emoji, I always thought this was dumb so I chose to spice it up by animating said emoji. If you're interested in contributing please message @jakeoid#6284 on Discord or by submitting a PR Request on the REPO.

So.. just what Emoji are edited?

##Installation

There are two easy ways to install the client, for this example im going to tell you how to install it using BeautifulDiscord. 

1. Download the [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) client, instructions for installing can be found there.

2. Clone my code that I have here,
```git clone https://github.com/jakeoid/disccord.git```

3. Re-run the BeautifulDiscord command.
```beautifuldiscord --css ./disccord/disccord.css``` 

Or if you already have a theme that you want to install it over the top of use..

```@import "https://cdn.rawgit.com/jakeoid/discord-emoji-anim/master/stylesheet.css"```

##Disclaimer

 - Yes, I know this is hacky
 - Yes, I know this is CSS abuse, and we should be in the internet jail right now
 - Yes, I know this isn't even properly formated
 - Yes, I know there's no point on doing this

So I am not responsible for any harm caused by this.
